- [Where do they come from? Identification of globular cluster escaped stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01133) Cheng Xu, Baitian Tang, Chengyuan Li 中山大学
	- 球状星团演化，通过化学丰度（N-rich）和动力学寻找场星起源的球状星团
	- **background**：
		- Globular clusters (GCs), as old as our Galaxy, constantly lose their members to the field as they cross through the Milky Way (MW).
		- **GC escaped stars (or escapees)** are suggested to contribute significantly to the **MW halo**.
		- **chemical finger prints**, e.g., **N enrichment**, may reveal its origin
	- **results**:
		- found **29 potential GC progenitors** for **15 N-rich field stars** by establishing dynamical connections between N-rich field stars recently identified by LAMOST and the existing MW GCs
		- successfully identified **more than 1600 extra-tidal candidates** in the vicinity of six Gaia-Enceladus (GE)-related GCs (i.e., NGC 1851, NGC 1904, NGC 6205, NGC 6341, NGC 6779, NGC 7089)
		- Among 95 extra-tidal candidates with spectroscopic radial velocities and metallicity, **54 of them are confirmed** to be GC escaped stars, which can be the ideal spectrocsopic follow-up targets for investigating the GC dynamical evolution (e.g., mass loss, rotation)

- [The Gaia RVS benchmark stars II. A sample of stars selected for their Gaia high radial velocity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02878)E. Caffau(GEPI), D. Katz (GEPI), A. Gómez(GEPI) 巴黎天文台
	- the **Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS)** on board Gaia has provided the radial velocity for **33 million stars**
	- to **verify the credibility** of measurements, some bright stars with the modulus of radial velocity in excess of 500 are observed with SOPHIE at OHP and UVES as VLT

- [Constraints on Triton atmospheric evolution from occultations: 1989-2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02476) B. Sicardy, A. Tej, A. R. Gomes-Junior
	- **background**：海卫一掩星，测量大气状况
		- a few occultations probed Triton's atmosphere in 1989, 1995, 1997, 2008 and 2017
		- a recent ground-based stellar occultation observed on 6 October 2022 provides a new measurement of Triton's atmospheric pressure which is presented here
	- Fits to the **occultation light curves** yield Triton's **atmospheric pressure** at the reference radius 1400 km, from which the surface pressure is induced. 掩星曲线的拟合，得出了海卫一在参考半径 1400 公里处的大气压力，并由此得出了表面压力。

- [The JWST Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science Program V. DOLPHOT Stellar Photometry for NIRCam and NIRISS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03504) Daniel R. Weisz, Andrew E. Dolphin, Alessandro Savino
	- 开发了 NIRCAM 和 NIRISS 的 DALPHOT 模块，并用 M92（银河系球状星团）、Draco II（超暗矮星系）和 WLM（恒星形成星系）做了测试，提供了推荐的DALPHOT参数以及观测建议和在线文档
	- **present NIRCAM and NIRISS modules for DOLPHOT**, describe details of the modules iincluding pixel masking, astrometric alignment, star finding, photometry, catalog creation, and artificial star tests (ASTs).
	- **tested** these modules using NIRCam and NIRISS images of **M92** (a Milky Way globular cluster), **Draco II** (an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy), and **WLM** (a star-forming dwarf galaxy)
	- systematic uncertainties: primary from **mismatches** in the model and observed point spread functions (**PSFs**) and **aperture** corrections
	- Temporal variations in the **photometry are generally $\lesssim0.01$ mag**, although rare large misalignment events can introduce errors up to 0.08 mag.
