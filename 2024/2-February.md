- [Where do they come from? Identification of globular cluster escaped stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01133) Cheng Xu, Baitian Tang, Chengyuan Li 中山大学
	- 球状星团演化，通过化学丰度（N-rich）和动力学寻找场星起源的球状星团
	- **background**：
		- Globular clusters (GCs), as old as our Galaxy, constantly lose their members to the field as they cross through the Milky Way (MW).
		- **GC escaped stars (or escapees)** are suggested to contribute significantly to the **MW halo**.
		- **chemical finger prints**, e.g., **N enrichment**, may reveal its origin
	- **results**:
		- found **29 potential GC progenitors** for **15 N-rich field stars** by establishing dynamical connections between N-rich field stars recently identified by LAMOST and the existing MW GCs
		- successfully identified **more than 1600 extra-tidal candidates** in the vicinity of six Gaia-Enceladus (GE)-related GCs (i.e., NGC 1851, NGC 1904, NGC 6205, NGC 6341, NGC 6779, NGC 7089)
		- Among 95 extra-tidal candidates with spectroscopic radial velocities and metallicity, **54 of them are confirmed** to be GC escaped stars, which can be the ideal spectrocsopic follow-up targets for investigating the GC dynamical evolution (e.g., mass loss, rotation)
