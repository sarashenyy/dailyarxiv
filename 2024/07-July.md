- [Tidal mass loss in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy through N-body simulations with Gaia EDR3-based orbits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01714) Pierfrancesco Di Cintio, Giuliano Iorio, Francesco Calura
	- **context**: Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) is a challenge for some globular cluster formation models because an exceptionally high fraction of its stellar mass is locked in its GC system. 天炉座矮球状星系（dSph）对一些球状星团（GC）形成模型来说是一个挑战，因为它的恒星质量中有相当大的一部分被锁定在它的GC系统中。
	- **aim**: constrain the amount of stellar mass that Fornax has lost via tidal interaction with the Milky Way (MW)
	- **method**: N-body simulation, study the evolution of the mass distribution of the Fornax dSph in observationally justified orbits in the gravitational potential of the MW over 12 Gyr
	- **results**: 
		- though the dark-matter mass loss can be substantial, the fraction of stellar mass lost by Fornax to the MW is always negligible, even in the most eccentric orbit considered 银河系潮汐作用造成的恒星质量损失可以忽略不计
		- conclude that stellar-mass loss due to tidal stripping is not a plausible explanation for the unexpectedly high stellar mass of the GC system of the Fornax dSph 潮汐剥离造成的质量损失并不能解释 Fornax dSph 的GC系统中出乎意料高的恒星质量

- [Search for Classical Cepheids in Galactic Open Clusters and Calibration of the Period Wesenheit Metallicity Relation in the Gaia Bands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01980) 王华健，徐烨（紫台）
	- calibrate the period Wesenheit metallicity relation (**PWZR**) of Delta Cephei stars (DCEPs) using Gaia DR3
	- **results**:
		- obtain a total of 43 OC-DCEPs (including 33 fundamental mode, 9 first overtone mode, and 1 multimode DCEPs)
		- calibrate the **PWZR** as $W_G=(-3.356 \,\pm\, 0.033) \,(\log{P-1})+(-5.947 \,\pm\, 0.025)+(-0.285 \,\pm\, 0.064)[\textrm{Fe/H}]$

- 🍃 [Cosmic accretion shocks as a tool to measure the dark matter mass of galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01660) David Vallés-Pérez, Vicent Quilis, Susana Planelles
	- **comments**: Accepted for publication in Nature Astronomy
	- **context**: 
		- Cosmological accretion shocks created during the formation of galaxy clusters are a ubiquitous phenomenon all around the Universe. 星系团形成过程中产生的宇宙吸积波
		- These shocks, and their features, are intimately related with the gravitational energy put into play during galaxy cluster formation. 这些冲击及其特征与星系团形成过程中产生的引力能量密切相关
	- **new insights**: 
		- a new approach to indirectly measure the dark matter content of galaxy clusters, with an error up to around 30% at the $1\sigma$ confidence level
		- a new and independent method to measure the dark matter mass in cosmic structures, and a novel constraint to the accepted $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.

## Mon, 8 Jul
- [Stellar Metallicities and Gradients in the Faint M31 Satellites Andromeda XVI and Andromeda XXVIII](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04698) Sal Wanying Fu, Daniel R. Weisz, Else Starkenburg
	- present **~300 stellar metallicity** measurements in **two faint M31 dwarf galaxies**, **Andromeda XVI** (16) ($M_v=-7.5$) and **Andromeda XXVIII** (28) ($M_v = -8.8$), derived using metallicity-sensitive Calcium H&K narrow-band HST imaging
	- the **first individual stellar metallicities in And XVI** (95 stars)
	- **results**:
		- And XVI: $<[\rm{Fe/H}]>=-2.17^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$, $\sigma \rm{[Fe/H]}=0.33^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$, $\Delta \rm{[Fe/H]}=-0.23\pm0.15 \ \rm{dex R}^{-1}$ 
		- And XXVIII:  $<[\rm{Fe/H}]>=-1.95^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, $\sigma \rm{[Fe/H]}=0.34^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$, $\Delta \rm{[Fe/H]}=-0.46\pm0.10 \ \rm{dex R}^{-1}$ 
		- And XVI is more metal-rich than MW UFDs of similar luminosity, which may be a result of its unusually extended star formation history
		- the stellar metallicity gradient measurements are **among the first for faint ($L ≲ 10^6 L\odot$) galaxies outside the Milky Way halo**.
		- consistent with predictions from the FIRE simulations

- [Isochrone fitting to the open cluster M67 in the era of Gaia and improved model physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03526) Claudia Reyes (澳大利亚), Dennis Stello, Marc Hon
	- **create new stellar models** that avoid commonly used simplifications in 1D stellar modeling, such as mass-independent core overshooting and a constant mixing length parameter 基于改进的疏散星团M67的等龄线，创建了新的恒星模型，避免常用的1D恒星建模的简化（质量依赖的core shooting, 常数的混合长度）
	- deliver a **precise isochrone** specifically designed for **M67**
	- **method**: qualitative approach to adjust the input physics to match the well-defined CMD sequence, test the model-predicted masses against a known eclipsing binary system at the main sequence turnoff of the cluster
	- **results**:
		- create new stellar models
		- deliver precise isochrone specifically for M67
		- despite using improvements in photometry and stellar physics, we **cannot match the masses of both binary components with the same theoretical isochrone**
		- a **chi-square-based isochrone fitting** approach using our preferred input physics results in a cluster age of $3.95^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ Gyr

- [Unveiling the purely young star formation history of the SMC's northeastern shell from colour-magnitude diagram fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13876) Joanna D. Sakowska, Noelia E. D. Noël
	- obtain a quantitative star formation history (SFH) of a shell-like structure ('shell') located in the northeastern part of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) 测量了SMC东北部壳状结构的恒星形成历史
	- **data**: the Survey of the MAgellanic Stellar History (SMASH)
	- **method**: compute the SFHs with CMD fitting
	- **results**:
		- for the first time, a novel technique that uses red clump (RC) stars from the CMDs to assess and account for the SMC's line-of-sight depth effect present during the SFH derivation; accounting for this effect recovers a more accurate SFH
		- quantify a **7 kpc line-of-sight depth** present in the CMDs
		- the northeastern shell is primarily composed of stars younger than 500 Myrs, with significant star formation enhancements around **250 Myr and 450 Myr**
		- show synchronicity between the northeastern shell's SFH with the Large Magellanic Cloud's (LMC) northern arm, which we attribute to the **interaction** history of the SMC with the LMC and the Milky Way (MW) over the past 500 Myr

- [Towards a universal analytical model for Population III star formation: interplay between feedback and fragmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14294) Boyuan Liu, James Gurian, Kohei Inayoshi
	- **context**: 
		- JWST has brought us new insights into Cosmic Dawn with tentative detection of the unique signatures of metal-free Population III (Pop III) stars, such as strong HeII emission, extremely blue UV spectrum, and enhanced nitrogen abundance. JWST尝试探测到Pop III星族（无金属）恒星的特征，为Cosmic Dawn提供新见解
		- Self-consistent theoretical predictions of the formation rates, sites, and masses of Pop III stars are crucial for interpreting the observations, but are challenging due to complex physical processes operating over the large range of length scales involved. Pop III星族恒星的形成速率、位置和质量的自洽理论预测，对解释观测结果很重要，但是这样的理论也很有挑战

	- **results**:
		- 模型首次考虑了反馈和碎片之间的相互作用

- [A "Rosetta Stone" for Studies of Spatial Variation in Astrophysical Data: Power Spectra, Semivariograms, and Structure Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14068) Benjamin Metha, Sabrina Berger (墨尔本大学)
	- **comments**: A pedagogical note, not submitted to any journals. 
	- **context**: Through different historical choices for mathematical conventions, many different subfields of spatial data analysis have evolved their own language for analysing structures and quantifying correlation in spatial data. Because of this history, terminology from a myriad of different fields is used, often to describe two data products that are mathematically identical. 由于历史的原因，术语及数学惯例没有得到统一
	- **content**:
		- define and describe the differences and similarities between **the power spectrum, the two-point correlation function, the covariance function, the semivariogram, and the structure functions**, in an effort to unify the languages used to study spatial correlation
		- highlight under which **conditions** these data products are useful and describe how the results found using one method can be translated to those found using another, allowing for easier comparison between different subfields' native methods
	- **Rosetta Stone**: hope for this document to be a "Rosetta Stone" for translating between different statistical approaches, allowing results to be shared between researchers from different backgrounds, facilitating more cross-disciplinary approaches to data analysis.
