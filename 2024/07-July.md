- [Tidal mass loss in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy through N-body simulations with Gaia EDR3-based orbits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01714) Pierfrancesco Di Cintio, Giuliano Iorio, Francesco Calura
	- **context**: Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) is a challenge for some globular cluster formation models because an exceptionally high fraction of its stellar mass is locked in its GC system. 天炉座矮球状星系（dSph）对一些球状星团（GC）形成模型来说是一个挑战，因为它的恒星质量中有相当大的一部分被锁定在它的GC系统中。
	- **aim**: constrain the amount of stellar mass that Fornax has lost via tidal interaction with the Milky Way (MW)
	- **method**: N-body simulation, study the evolution of the mass distribution of the Fornax dSph in observationally justified orbits in the gravitational potential of the MW over 12 Gyr
	- **results**: 
		- though the dark-matter mass loss can be substantial, the fraction of stellar mass lost by Fornax to the MW is always negligible, even in the most eccentric orbit considered 银河系潮汐作用造成的恒星质量损失可以忽略不计
		- conclude that stellar-mass loss due to tidal stripping is not a plausible explanation for the unexpectedly high stellar mass of the GC system of the Fornax dSph 潮汐剥离造成的质量损失并不能解释 Fornax dSph 的GC系统中出乎意料高的恒星质量

- [Search for Classical Cepheids in Galactic Open Clusters and Calibration of the Period Wesenheit Metallicity Relation in the Gaia Bands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01980) 王华健，徐烨（紫台）
	- calibrate the period Wesenheit metallicity relation (**PWZR**) of Delta Cephei stars (DCEPs) using Gaia DR3
	- **results**:
		- obtain a total of 43 OC-DCEPs (including 33 fundamental mode, 9 first overtone mode, and 1 multimode DCEPs)
		- calibrate the **PWZR** as $W_G=(-3.356 \,\pm\, 0.033) \,(\log{P-1})+(-5.947 \,\pm\, 0.025)+(-0.285 \,\pm\, 0.064)[\textrm{Fe/H}]$

- 🍃 [Cosmic accretion shocks as a tool to measure the dark matter mass of galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01660) David Vallés-Pérez, Vicent Quilis, Susana Planelles
	- **comments**: Accepted for publication in Nature Astronomy
	- **context**: 
		- Cosmological accretion shocks created during the formation of galaxy clusters are a ubiquitous phenomenon all around the Universe. 星系团形成过程中产生的宇宙吸积波
		- These shocks, and their features, are intimately related with the gravitational energy put into play during galaxy cluster formation. 这些冲击及其特征与星系团形成过程中产生的引力能量密切相关
	- **new insights**: 
		- a new approach to indirectly measure the dark matter content of galaxy clusters, with an error up to around 30% at the $1\sigma$ confidence level
		- a new and independent method to measure the dark matter mass in cosmic structures, and a novel constraint to the accepted $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.
