- [The SMILES Mid-Infrared Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03518) George Rieke, Stacey Alberts, Irene Shivaei
	- 介绍红外巡天历史，总结MIRI的科学应用
	- **MIRI**: **eight** intermediate-width bands from 5 to 26 microns, a narrower one at 11.3 microns; previous infrared space telescopes only have **two** broad bands, one near 10 microns and the other near 20 microns (MIRI有5-26微米的8个中宽波段和11.3微米的较窄波段的光谱覆盖，而以前的只有2个红外滤光片)  

- [An Empirical Calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distance Method in the Near Infrared. II. JWST NIRCam Wide Filters](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03532) Max J. B. Newman, Kristen B. W. McQuinn, Evan D. Skillman... Andrew E. Dolphin
	 - **context**: 
		 - the tip of Red Giant (TRGB) is a standardizable candle and is identifiable as the discontinuity at the bright extreme of the Red Giant branch (RGB) in the CMD space
		 - TRGB-based distance is used to measure distances to galaxies out to $D \leq 20$ Mpc with the I-band HST F814W filter, and as an important rung in the distance ladder to measure the Hubble constant $\rm{H}_{0}$
		 - with JWST, TRGB method can be extended to $\sim 50$ Mpc
	 - **results**: 
		 - TRGB luminosity depends on stellar metallicity and age
		 - standardize TRGB luminosity using stellar colors as a proxy for metallicity/age to derive color-based corrections for the JWST Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) short wavelength (SW) filters F090W, F115W, F150W, and the long wavelength (LW) filters F277W, F356W, and F444W. 用恒星的颜色作为金属性/年龄的代用指标，对TRGB光度进行了标准化处理，从而得出了NIRCam短波长滤光片F090W、F115W、F150W和长波长滤光片F277W、F356W、F444W的基于颜色的修正值。

- [The Structure of Massive Star-Forming Galaxies from JWST and ALMA: Dusty, High Redshift Disk Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03544) Steven Gillman, Ian Smail, Bitten Gullberg
	- JWST **PRIMER** project: nircam和miri的80个大质量dusty star- formation星系的形态分析

- [Molecular Cloud Matching in CO and Dust in M33 I. High-Resolution Hydrogen Column Density Maps from Herschel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03601) Eduard Keilmann, Christof Buchbender, Volker Ossenkopf-Okada
	- M33的dustmap，Herschel的数据（欧洲的，已经退役了十年了）
	- **Herschel**: 2009年5月14日和普朗克卫星一起于位于法属圭亚那的空间中心由亚利安五号火箭发射升空，并成功进入距离地球150万公里环绕着L2拉格朗日点，直径70万公里的利萨如轨道。2013年4月29日，它因液氦冷却剂耗尽，已停止工作。
	- 题外，The Great Observatories（四个，以人名命名的都是高级望远镜）：chandra, spizer, hst, jwst
	- **results**:
		- calculate a map of carbon monoxide $\rm{CO-to-H_2}$ 测CO的目的，最终是看恒星形成，所以要转换到氢上

- [Contribution of young massive star clusters to Galactic diffuse γ-ray emission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04087) Stefano Menchiari, Giovanni Morlino, Elena Amato
	- **Context**: 
		- Young massive stellar clusters (YMSCs) have emerged as potential γ-ray sources, after the recent association of a dozen YMSCs with extended γ-ray emission. The large size of the detected halos, comparable to that of the wind-blown bubble expected around YMSCs, makes the γ-ray detection of individual YMSCs rather challenging.
		- As a result, the emission from most of the Galactic YMSCs could be unresolved, thus contributing to the diffuse γ-ray radiation observed along the Galactic Plane.
	- **Aims**: estimate the possible contribution to the Galactic diffuse γ-ray emission from a synthetic population of YMSCs
	- **Methods**: evaluate the contribution of γ-ray emission relying on the simulation of synthetic populations of YMSCs based on the observed properties of local clusters; compute the γ-ray emission from each cluster assuming that the radiation is purely hadronic and produced by cosmic rays
	- **Results**: 
		- find that the γ-ray emission from unresolved YMSCs can significantly contribute to the observed Galactic diffuse flux, especially in the inner part of the Galaxy. 
		- The result is independent of the assumed particle transport, but an important role is played by Wolf-Rayet stars. 
		- The predicted γ-ray flux should be considered as a lower limit, given that our calculation neglects the contribution of supernovae exploding in YMSCs.

- [Photometric Classification of Stars Around the Milky Way's Central Black Hole: I. Central Parsec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04166) E. Gallego-Cano, T. Fritz, R. Schödel
	- **context**: 
		- The presence of young massive stars in the Galactic Centre (GC) raises questions about star formation near the black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) 
		- the initial mass function (IMF) in this region appears different from the standard Salpeter/Kroupa law
		- Extreme extinction and crowding limit our understanding of the stellar population, with spectroscopic data available only for selected bright sources
	- **aim**: improve knowledge about the distribution and IMF of young, massive stars near Sgr A*
	- **methods**: 
		- Using intermediate band (IB) photometry, we identify candidates for massive young stars through Bayesian inference, a neural network, and a gradient-boosted trees algorithm
		- obtained spectral energy distributions for 6590 stars, 1181 of which have been previously classified spectroscopically
	- **results**:
		- identify 351 stars classified as early types by all three methods, including 155 newly identified candidates
		- infer a top-heavy IMF of young stars near Sgr A* (R < 9''), with a power-law of 1.6 +- 0.1; at greater distances, a standard Salpeter/Kroupa IMF fits the data
		- The IMF variation with radial distance suggests different star formation mechanisms, with a top-heavy IMF near Sgr A* consistent with disc star formation. IMF 随径向距离的变化表明不同的恒星形成机制，人马座 A* 附近的头重脚轻的初始质量函数与盘状恒星形成一致。

> apjs影响因子高，有catalog，明明有科学但是还是发apjs，就是因为分区和影响因子，对学生去高校找工作有利
